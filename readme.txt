AtariAge Dashboard Feed

== Description ==
Stay up to date with the latest AtariAge news by including the AtariAge RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed directly within your WordPress Dashboard. We have a great respect for AtariAge and everything Atari for that matter, but there isn't as much time to check in with the site as we would like. To reconcile this issue we added the AtariAge RSS feed. This plugin displays the publication date, a post excerpt, the familiar AtariAge shield and a customizable configuration panel. Configuration includes: number of posts displayed, removal of the post date and removal of the excerpt.

This plugin is dedicated to Albert Yarusso, a good friend and hands down the biggest contributor to keeping the spirit of Atari alive.
